# JShell
A bash replica written in Java

To run this program, you must have docker installed and Visual Studio Code. Open VS Code, run docker, and open the VS Code terminal. Once docker is running type:

docker build -t jsh .  // this builds the docker image
docker run -it --rm jsh /bin/bash    // this runs the program.

The program should then be running your VS Code terminal.
